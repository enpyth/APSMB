Investment Industry and Policy Forum

The 13th APMBC and 5th ANZMBS  conference are combining to engage  marine biotechnologists, industry,  investors, and policy makers in  current marine biotechnology  research, and industry development  in the Asia-Pacific region.
This is the first time the APMBC will  be held in the Australia/New Zealand  region. The combination of Australian  and New Zealand marine territories  makes it the second largest in the
world and the largest in the Asia-Pacific  region, with a rich biodiversity.
This provides a great opportunity  to participate in the growth and  future development of the marine
biotechnology industry in the region  and globally.
A key objective of the joint Conference  is to encourage academic-industry  partnerships across the region.
A key feature of the conference  program will be the balance of  academic and industry participants.
The program also offers industry,  investment and policy forums to  align industry needs and government
priorities with productive collaborations  and research and development  essential for achieving industry’s full  potential.

# Roundtables

1. Blue Carbon

When protected or restored, blue carbon ecosystems sequester and store carbon. 
When degraded or destroyed, these ecosystems emit the carbon they have stored for centuries into the atmosphere and oceans and become sources of greenhouse gases. Experts estimate that as much as 1.02 billion tons of carbon dioxide are being released annually from degraded coastal ecosystems, which is equivalent to 19% of emissions from tropical deforestation globally. The round table will discuss practical initiatives that could be implemented and accelerated

2. Blue AGRICULTURE
The Growing Consumer Interest about the Source of Their Food and Agricultural Inputs Used In Them Can Lead To a Significant Boost in Demand for Seaweed Bio-Fertilizers in the Forthcoming Years. Seaweed bio-stimulants are a source of oligo-elements such as cytokinesis, auxins, gibberellins, amino acids, and complex sugars, and they are also high in inorganic elements like nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and iron. These vital nutritional ingredients ensure the nutrition seaweed needs, enhancing the world's Seaweed Bio-fertilizers market's economic growth over the next few years.

3. MARINE BIOMANUFACTURING
Biopharmaceutical companies face greater challenges than ever before when developing new large molecule and small molecule products. Therapeutic targets in the pipeline are increasing due to the rise in mRNA, specialized medicines, oncology treatments, orphan indications, and more. The new development in marine biomanufacturing could bring an added value to the existing sector. The round table will discuss the new discoveries

4. CELLULAR MARICULTURE
Cellular mariculture is the process of producing animal-based foods and other products directly from marine organism’s cells and could be a valid and sustainable source of alternative proteins. The development of cellular mariculture is motivated by the need to develop a sustainable food production system, addressing the overuse of antibiotics, food and water safety, environmental footprint, and animal welfare.
